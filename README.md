# BattlemetricsBot

  A Discord Bot that retrieves and displays information from the popular game-server analytic site, Battlemetrics.

# Setup 

  I had to remove my personal discord bot token because there were spiders roaming around <br />
  collecting the tokens to send malicious links to people. To make this bot work, please open <br />
  the auth.json file and enter your own personal discord bot token obtainable at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ <br />

# Commands

(prefix)help - Displays the help menu for the bot and all the commands that it recognizes. <br />
(prefix)prefix <newPrefix> - Changes the current prefix that the bot uses to recognize commands. <br />
(prefix)server <serverID> - Makes the bot send <b>live</b> battlemetrics data about the server. <br />
