# BattlemetricsBot

  A Discord Bot that retrieves and displays information from the popular game-server analytic site, Battlemetrics.

# Setup 

  I had to remove my personal discord bot token because there were spiders roaming around <br />
  collecting the tokens to send malicious links to people. To make this bot work, please open <br />
  the auth.json file and enter your own personal discord bot token obtainable at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ <br />
  
# Starting the Bot

  Clone this package into a folder and open a command terminal. <br />
  Make sure install all dependencies and navigate to the new folder using cd. <br />
  <b> npm install unirest winston discord.io discord.js </b> <br />
  Install node.js such that it recognizes commands made to it. <br />
  Do node main.js to start the bot!

# Commands

(prefix)help - Displays the help menu for the bot and all the commands that it recognizes. <br />

(prefix)list <query> - Makes a query to the battlemetrics site to return the top 10 results. <br />
